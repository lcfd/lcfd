Hi there 👋 Nice to meet you!

I'm a software developer from Italy 🇮🇹

Pythonista at heart, but I'm sure I spent more time on JavaScript.
Usually, I mix them by using Django and React. I'm a fan of the htmx approach.

My Neovim configuration is my zen garden 🧘‍♂️

I created [Fōkasu](https://fokasu.app/) a browser extension. At the moment I'm building [Hirebud](https://twitter.com/hirebudHQ) and [Trak](https://usetrak.com).

I'm part of the [Speck&Tech](https://speckand.tech/) and [Python Italia](https://www.python.it/comunita/) communities.

If you think I can help with your open-source project or I can work with you, feel free to **contact me**.
