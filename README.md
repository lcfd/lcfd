### Luca Fedrizzi

Hi there 👋 Nice to meet you!

I'm a freelance dev from Italy 🇮🇹

Pythonista at heart, but I spent more time on JavaScript.<br>
I mix those two languages by using Django and React.

[My Neovim configuration](https://github.com/lcfd/NaryaVim) is my zen garden 🧘‍♂️

I enjoy creating small products, for example:

* [Fōkasu](https://fokasu.app/), a browser extension that helps to focus on just one thing
* [Trak](https://usetrak.com), the time tracking CLI

I'm part of the [Speck&Tech](https://speckand.tech/) and [Python Italia](https://www.python.it/comunita/) communities.<br>
I'm trying to revive the [PyTrento](https://trento.python.it/) community.
